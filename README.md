# Repository for OCP samples to show

In this repository, I am going to collect some resources that could be useful to show some basic use cases:

- Deploy a container image
- Deploy an application from a git repository (https://github.com/kubealex/go-examples.git - sample-webserver)
- Deploy an application from an helm chart
- Expose a container using services and routes
- Use a debug pod to troubleshoot a node
- Manage Roles
- Add SCC to users
